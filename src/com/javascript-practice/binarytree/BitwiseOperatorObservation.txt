Convert Binary to Decimal:
1010 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1+ 0*2^0
     = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 
     = 10
Observation
Focus only one, because remaining will turn into zero when multiply by zero
How to convert Fractional Binary to Decimal
Example:
2^3   2^2  2^1 2^0  2^-1 2^-2 2^-3  
1     1    0   0 .  1    0    1

Observation:
2^-1 = 1/2 = 0.5
2^3 = 1/8 = 0.125
Observation:
2^0 = 1

Observation:
1) AND
    When you &1 with any number, the digit remain the same.
   i) Any AND with 0 its zero 
   
2) XOR (^) (if and only if)
a ^ 1  = a~ (a's compliment)
a ^ 0   = a
a ^ a  = 0

Left Shift
a << 1 = 2a

General point
a << b  = a*2^b

Right Shift
------------
Its move one bit to the Right
 general point 
 a >> b = a/2^b

 Odd or Even:
 Just check last bit , if its 1 is odd othewise even (also call least significant bit)

 Negative of a number is binary form:

 1 byte = 8 bits
 Most significant bit is first bit from left: thats tells us whether positive or negative
  1  = Negative
  0  = Positive
Remaining bits represent value of the number

Steps:
1) compliment of that no.(aka 2s complement)
2) add +1 to it
