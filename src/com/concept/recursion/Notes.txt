Recursion Related Space:
The recursion related space refers to the memory cost incurred directly by the stack
to keep track of recursive function calls.
The system allocates some space in stack to hold following information

1) The returning address of the function call, once the function call is completed, the program must
know where to return to i.e. the line of the code after the function call

2) The parameters that are passed to the function call
3) The local variables within the function call

Tail Recursion: Exempted from this space overhead
Tail recursion where recursive call is the final instruction in the recursive function.
There should be only one recursive call in the function
The benefit of tail recursion is that it could avoid the accumulation of stack overheads
during the recursive calls, since the system could reuse a fixed amount of space in the stack recursive call.
Tips:
1) When in doubt, write down the recurrence relationships
2) Whenever possible apply memoization
