 * An array A contains all the integers from 0 through n, except for one number

 * The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use 
 * to access then is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]", which take constant time.
 * Write a code to find the missing integer. can you do it in O(n) time ?
